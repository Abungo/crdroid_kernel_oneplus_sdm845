## Hola amiguitos

This is my attempt to fix up and add a little crDroid customization flavor back into the sdm845 kernel tree for OnePlus 6 & 6T (enchilada & fajita).

- Rebased on edwinmoq's lineage-21-4.19 branch as of February 2024.
- Other goodies gathered from over the years including work from Anierin Bliss, mcdachpappe, and snnbyyds (among others I'm sure).
